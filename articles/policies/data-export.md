# Data Export Policy
If you would like to export your data from Auth0 there are a several ways you can do this. You can use our [Import/Export Extension](/extensions/user-import-export) to export nearly all data in your Auth0 account. You can also use the [Management API](/api/management/v2) to export specific types of data.
