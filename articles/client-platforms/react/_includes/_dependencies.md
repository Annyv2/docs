The only Auth0-related dependency that is required to get started is the [Lock widget](/lock). The widget can be retrieved either from npm or from Auth0's CDN.

**npm**

```bash
npm install auth0-lock
```

**CDN**

```html
<script src="${lock_url}"></script>
```

> **Note**: The samples utilize the auth0-lock package from npm rather than referencing the CDN link.
