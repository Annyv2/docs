  <h1>Hooks</h1>
  <p>
    Hooks allow you to extend the Auth0 platform with custom code.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>What are Hooks?</h2>
<p>
  Hooks allow you to customize the behavior of Auth0 using Node.js code that is executed against extensibility points (which are comparable to webhooks that come with a server). Hooks allow you modularity when configuring your Auth0 implementation, and extend the functionality of base Auth0 features.
</p>

<h3> Hooks vs. Rules </h3>
<p>
  Hooks will eventually replace Rules, the current Auth0 extensibility method. Currently, you can use both Hooks and Rules, but Auth0 will implement new functionality in Hooks.
