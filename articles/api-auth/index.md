# API Authentication and Authorization

At some point, your APIs will need to allow limited access to users, servers, or servers on behalf of users.

Auth0's API authorization features allow you to manage the authorization requirements for server-to-server and client-to-server applications.

By using the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework, you can give your own applications or third-party applications limited access to your APIs on behalf of the application itself.

Using Auth0, you can easily support different flows in your own APIs without worrying about the OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect specification, or the many other technical aspects of API authorization.

### Participants

Several participants in the OAuth 2.0 specification can be identified:

 - **Authorization Server**: Auth0, in this case
 - **Resource Servers**: your APIs
 - **Clients**: the consumers of your APIs, which can include third-party applications or your own customers
 - **Resource Owner**: the user of your APIs and of the applications
 - **User Agent**: the user's browser or mobile app

Using different grants (or flows), these participants will interact to grant Clients limited access to the Resource Servers you are building. As a result, the Client will obtain an `access_token` that can be used to call the Resource Server on behalf of the user or of the Client itself.
